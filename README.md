# Connect4_Game
# Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.
